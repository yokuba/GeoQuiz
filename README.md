# GeoQuiz
Geography quiz application for Android devices. This is a work in progress from The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. In the future, I plan to add sqlite database functionality so that the user can select different quiz options and keep track of performance.

The basic UI allows the user to hit true or false, and feedback is given right away. Start the quiz:

Let's say the user enters the incorrect answer of 'false':

If user touches the 'Cheat!' button, the user can still turn back...

If user opts to cheat, that is recorded:

The quiz knows that you cheated:
